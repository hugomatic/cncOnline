HUGOMATIC README


Hugomatic is a library for GCODE generation in Python.


RUNNING ON LOCAL MACHINE
========================

Windows:
You need to install Python 2.5 or later

Linux:

Mac:
?




WEB SERVER INSTRUCTION
======================

To run the application as a web server on your local machine, execute the python script httpd.py in the hugomatic/web directory.

python httpd.py

Because it is a cgi application, every Python file that corresponds to a web page must be executable. Setting the executable flag for every Python file is a good strategy. 

Here's a typical error:


localhost - - [23/Jan/2009 17:46:43] "GET /index.py HTTP/1.1" 200 -
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/CGIHTTPServer.py", line 251, in run_cgi
    os.execve(scriptfile, args, os.environ)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied


As an example, here's the Unix command to set the index.py file to executable:

chmod +x index.py

Finally, the Python executable path must be set correctly. Every script has the following comment:

#!/usr/bin/python

You may have to create a link to your Python executable in your /usr/bin directory or change the comment to something like:

#!env python
